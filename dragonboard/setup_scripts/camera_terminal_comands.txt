(Use after using env_setup)

List devices:
v4l2-ctl --list-devices

Check for formats
v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext

Check for options:
v4l2-ctl -L

Change brightness:
v4l2-ctl -c brightness=64

Take photo with FFmpeg:
ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -frames 1 ./output.jpg

Take video:
ffmpeg -video_size 640x480 -framerate 30 -i /dev/video0 -t 4 -thread 4 -vcodec libx264 output.mp4
(This is pretty self explanatory what it does. Note that -t 4 stands 
for 4 seconds of recording and an -acodec is needed if you 
want audio included, but this will depend on your webcams 
capabilities. This file was 344 KB large.

If we add -preset ultrafast we tell FFmpeg to use the least 
amount of compression and results in a higher bitrate but 
faster recording. This file was 1.48 MB large.

Lastly we could add an option such as -crf 0 to the ultrafast 
preset option as well. This is our constant rate factor and by 
setting it to 0 we will have a lossless video. Note this file 
was 7.64 MB large.)
